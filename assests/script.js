// For my psuedo code I need to make a function to display my questions.
// I will also need a listner to start a countdown timer when I begin the quiz.
// then I will need a function to verify answers given are correct and if they are wrong then I need to take time away from the player.
// at the end of the quiz I then need to display the score and a box for the player to input their name.
